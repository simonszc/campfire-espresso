It contains an initial frontpage (index.html) for customer use, and a back-end page (data.html) that can calculate hourly traffic and sales for each for Campfire Coffee's stores, and take input for a new store with minimum and maximum hourly foot traffic and average sale data. The front page includes store data, room for a message to the customer, and navigation element for the creation of a larger site with merchandising sales.
